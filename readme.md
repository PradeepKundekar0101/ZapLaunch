**ZapLaunch** is a full-stack web application designed to automate the deployment of GitHub repositories. Users can log in via GitHub, configure build settings, and deploy projects effortlessly using AWS infrastructure. ZapLaunch provides real-time feedback on build logs and serves the deployed application via AWS CloudFront.

## About

ZapLaunch simplifies the process of deploying web applications by integrating GitHub for repo selection and AWS services for building and hosting. The platform allows users to:
- Authenticate via GitHub OAuth.
- Configure project settings such as the source directory, branch, custom build/install commands, and environment variables.
- Automatically deploy projects using AWS ECS, Docker, and S3.
- View real-time deployment logs directly within the app.
- Serve the deployed project through CloudFront for fast content delivery.

## Features

- **GitHub OAuth Login**: Users can sign in using their GitHub accounts to easily integrate their repositories.
- **Custom Build Configurations**: Customize project settings like source directory, branch, build/install commands, and environment variables.
